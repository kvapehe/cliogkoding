Note:
This is a less restrictive license than the MIT License which has a 
license and copyright notice.
There is no need to attribute med with your potentially use, but make sure if you use any of the 
information on this repository that if there is others work with a license, that you chect the use of that part.

Intentially I do not try to use others work, and try to credit others work in my code, where appropriate,
but mainly the links are for my use, in order to find the source later.

By potentially copying some work from this reposisitory you risk infringing others work, if I have not creditet properly.
If I am awaro of this later, I will try to fix it, so this not, may be invalidatet later.
As of 2023-05 not all is 100% correct, but will be fixed un later updates.
